                    <h1>In this website you will learn all the basic concepts of flow control in C language.</h1>
                    <p>First a few words about C and it's origin.</p>
                    <p>
                        C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting 
                        structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static 
                        type system. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical 
                        machine instructions. It has found lasting use in applications previously coded 
                        in assembly language. Such applications include operating systems and various 
                        application software for computer architectures that range from supercomputers 
                        to PLCs and embedded systems.<br>
                        A successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell Labs 
                        by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix. It 
                        was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system. During the 
                        1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become one of the most widely used 
                        programming languages, with C compilers from various vendors available for the majority 
                        of existing computer architectures and operating systems. C has been standardized by 
                        the ANSI since 1989 (ANSI C) and by the International Organization for Standardization 
                        (ISO).<br>
                        C is an imperative procedural language. It was designed to be compiled to provide 
                        low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine 
                        instructions, all with minimal runtime support. Despite its low-level capabilities, 
                        the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming. A standards-compliant 
                        C program written with portability in mind can be compiled for a wide variety of computer 
                        platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code.

                        Specifically, reading this tutorial you will get the chance to learn the following:
                        <ul>
                            <li>C if...else Statement</li>
                            <li>C for Loop</li>
                            <li>C while and do...while Loop</li>
                            <li>C break and continue</li>
                            <li>C switch Statement</li>
                            <li>C goto Statement</li>
                        </ul>
